			13. Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver
		  </div>
		  <div className='py-1'>
			13.1 Governing Law. You agree that: (a) the Service will be deemed
			solely based in Delaware; and (b) the Service will be deemed a passive
			one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either
			specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Delaware. These Terms
			will be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of
			Delaware, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The
			parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving
			interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with
			respect to the substantive law governing these Terms, the Federal
			Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (&quot;FAA&quot;) governs the interpretation
			and enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement below and preempts all
			state laws (and laws of other jurisdictions) to the fullest extent
			permitted by Applicable Law. If the FAA is found to not apply to any
			issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then
			that issue will be resolved under and governed by the law of the U.S.
			state where you live (if applicable) or the jurisdiction mutually
			agreed upon in writing by you and us. The application of the United
			Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
			expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal
			jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Delaware for
			any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other
			equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the
			actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of
			our Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights, as set
			forth in the Arbitration Agreement below, including any provisional
			relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Delaware
			is the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration
			award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the Arbitration
			Agreement below is found to be unenforceable.
		  </div>
		  <div className='py-1'>
			13.2 Arbitration. READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE
			PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU
			CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM LANY. This Arbitration Agreement applies to and
			governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and Lany that
			arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (a) these Terms,
			including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement,
			interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof; (b) access to or
			use of the Service, including receipt of any advertising or marketing
			communications; (c) any transactions through, by, or using the
			Service; or (d) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions
			with Lany, directly or indirectly, as a consumer (each, a &quot;Claim,&quot;
			and, collectively, &quot;Claims&quot;). This Arbitration Agreement will apply,
			without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before
			or after your agreement to these Terms.
		  </div>
		  <div className='py-1'>
			If you are a new User, you can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration
			Agreement within thirty (30) days of accepting these Terms by emailing
			Lany at thesheriff@goai.so with your full, legal name and stating your
			intent to opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement. Note that opting out
			of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect any other part of these
			Terms, including the provisions regarding controlling law or the
			courts in which any disputes must be brought.
		  </div>
		  <div className='py-1'>
			For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at thesheriff@goai.so and
			to attempt to resolve the Claim with us informally. In the unlikely
			event that we have not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60)
			days, we each agree to resolve such Claim exclusively through binding
			arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) before a
			single arbitrator (the &quot;Arbitrator&quot;), under the Expedited Procedures
			then in effect for AAA (the &quot;Rules&quot;), except as provided herein. In
			the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration
			Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement will control. AAA may be
			contacted at www.adr.org, where the Rules are also available. The
			arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. county where you live (if
			applicable) or Sussex County, Delaware, unless you and Lany agree
			otherwise. You acknowledge and understand that, depending on the kind
			of User you are, either (i) each of you and us will be responsible for
			paying any AAA filing and administrative and Arbitrator fees in
			accordance with the Rules, and the award rendered by the Arbitrator
			will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys&apos; fees, and
			reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, or (ii) AAA may
			require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you
			apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from AAA; the award
			rendered by the Arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your
			reasonable attorneys&apos; fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and
			other witnesses; and you may sue in a small claims court of competent
			jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this would not
			absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute
			resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the
			Arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You
			and Lany agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or
			local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve any
			disputes relating to the scope, interpretation, applicability,
			enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including
			any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void
			or voidable. The Arbitrator will also be responsible for determining
			all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to
			whether these Terms are, or any provision of these Terms is,
			unconscionable or illusory, and any defense to arbitration, including
			waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, and/or estoppel.
		  </div>
		  <div className='py-1'>
			Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed as: preventing
			Lany from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts
			as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,
			misappropriation, or violation of its data security, Intellectual
			Property Rights, or other proprietary rights; or preventing you from
			asserting claims in small claims court, provided that your claims
			qualify, and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances
			on only an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.
		  </div>
		  <div className='py-1'>
			If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or
			unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful
			provision, in whole or in part, will be severed. Severance of the
			void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will
			have no impact on the remaining provisions of this Arbitration
			Agreement, which will remain in force, or on the parties&apos; ability to
			compel arbitration of any remaining Claims on an individual basis
			pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
			if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver below is found to be void,
			unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would
			prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute
			regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must
			be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of
			competent jurisdiction. All other claims for relief subject to
			arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement will be arbitrated under
			its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute
			regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief will be stayed
			pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.

			13.3 Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver. REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF USER
			YOU ARE, INCLUDING WHETHER YOU ARE A NATURAL PERSON OR AN ENTITY, ANY
			CLAIM MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES&apos; INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS
			A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE
			ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE
			PROCEEDING. THIS CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS
			ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT
			CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON&apos;S CLAIMS. YOU AND LANY AGREE THAT THE
			ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO
			THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).
			ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER USERS. YOU AND LANY FURTHER
			AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND LANY ARE EACH
			WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE
			IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION,
			OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS
			MEMBER.

			15.4 No Waiver. No waiver of any term of these Terms will be deemed a
